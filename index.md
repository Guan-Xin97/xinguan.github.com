## Research Experience 

### Verification of lncRNA and circRNA in Osteogenic Differentiation Based on Next-generation Sequencing         _(06/2018-06/2019)_         
Assisted in completing the following tasks:   
* Utilized BMP-2(bone morphogenetic protein 2) to induce MC3T3E1 cell to differentiate into osteoblast  
* Obtained 48687 mRNAs and 1806 annotated lncRNAs after extracting RNA fragments from experimental group and control group by high-throughput sequencing  
* Gained 171 lncRNAs and 55 circRNAs which could be expressed differentially in the process of osteogenic differentiation 

Independently accomplished the following tasks about LncRNAs:  
* Looked for the pairs of mRNA and LncRNA which were differentially expressed during osteogenic differentiation and had co-location and co-expression relationship with each other  
* Selected the ENSMUST00000145585.1(LncRNA) and Optn(mRNA) as experimental objects from the candidates by employing several standards, like the relationship between gene and bone related metabolic processes, p-value etc.  
* Formed several assumptions of the interaction between Optn and ENSMUST00000145585.1 by predicting subcellular localization of ENSMUST00000145585.1, comparing the positional relationship between each transcript of Optn and ENSMUST00000145585.1 and forecasting the binding of ENSMUST00000145585.1 and Optn protein  
* Adopted the sequence of ENSMUST00000145585.1 to construct a plasmid and transfect the C2C12 cells  
* Detected the result of overexpression by real-time quantitative PCR   
* Measured the expression of Optn by real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot Independently finish the following tasks about circRNAs:   
* Chose the mmu_circ_0000104 as the experimental object according to p-value  
* Designed the primers to detect the expression of the mmu_circ_0000104  

### Obesity Related SNP Detection Penal                                                                                _(07/2019-now)_ 
* Searched GIANT database and papers for discovering SNP associated with obesity from different samples through GWAS and partly data from UCSC by R  
* Gained basic information from GWAS Catalog database, including SNP-risk allele, initial sample size, related gene, OR/beta, disease/treat etc.  
* Formed a standard to evaluate the SNP including p-value, race, sample size and other terms with different score  
* Screened out the top 40 as research objects and designed different kinds of primers for each of them for different experiments like SYBR-Green and Taq-Man, and weigh efficiency of each method against its market value  
* Formed an obesity scoring system by using OR-GRS to assign weight to each SNP 

### Tuberculosis (TB) Related SNP Detection Penal                                                                  _(07/2019-now)_  
* Constructed and improved the literature screening system for tuberculosis biomarkers, on the basis of the related literature  
* Screened thousands of literature that meet the requirements and summarized the information of biomarkers  
* Constructed a mathematical model to comprehensively evaluate several aspects of a biomarker, such as correlation of a biomarker with tuberculosis and the reliability of the data  
* Selected Top 10 biomarkers as candidate for latter experiments 

### Lung Cancer Gene Detection Panel by Using Circulating Tumor DNA in Peripheral Blood                               _(07/2019-now)_  
* Searched TCGA database and papers for finding lung cancer related genes and collected information about their functions (cancer suppressor gene or proto-oncogene) and action modes (mutation/fusion/methylation/transcript variants/SNP/exon skipping) as well as the sub-types of lung cancer
